CD-GraB paper is accepted by NeurIPS'23! Thanks for my collaborators and my advisor Prof. Chris De Sa! We extend our previous GraB paper with dencentralized data in parameter server setting and propose CD-GraB algorithm. We could find a better distributed data permutation than distributed random reshuffling with decentralized data!
